<h1>How programs get run</h1>

<div class="GAByline">
           <p>January 28, 2015</p>
           <p>This article was contributed by David Drysdale</p>
           </div>
<p>
      This is the first in pair of articles that describe how the kernel runs programs: what happens under the covers
      when a user program invokes
      the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html"><tt>execve()</tt></a> system call?
      I recently worked on the implementation of a new <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execveat.2.html"><tt>execveat()</tt></a> system call, which is a close variant
      of <tt>execve()</tt> that allows the caller to specify the invoked program by a combination of file descriptor
      and path, as with other <tt>*at()</tt> system calls.  (This will, in turn, enable an implementation of
      the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fexecve.3.html"><tt>fexecve()</tt></a> library function that
      doesn't <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fexecve.3.html#NOTES">rely on</a> access to
      the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem, which is important for sandboxed environments such
      as <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/604015/">Capsicum</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, I explored the existing <tt>execve()</tt> implementation, and so these articles
      present the details of that functionality.  In this one, we'll focus on the general mechanisms
      that the kernel uses for program invocation, which allow for different program formats; the second
      article will focus on the details of running ELF binaries.
    </p>


    <h4>The view from user space</h4>
    <p>
      Before diving into the kernel, we'll start by exploring the behavior of program execution from user space (there's
      also a good description of this behavior in chapter 27 of <a href="http://man7.org/tlpi/index.html"><i>The Linux
      Programming Interface</i></a>).  For Linux versions up to and including 3.18, the only system call that invokes a new
      program is <tt>execve()</tt>, which has the
      following prototype:
    

<tt></tt></p><pre><tt>    int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
</tt></pre>
<p>
      The <tt>filename</tt> argument specifies the program to be executed, and the <tt>argv</tt> and <tt>envp</tt>
      arguments are NULL-terminated lists that specify the command line arguments and environment variables for the new
      program.  A simple <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/630754/#do_execve">skeleton
    driver program (<tt>do_execve.c</tt>)</a> allows us to explore how this
    behaves, by 
      feeding in <tt>"zero"</tt>, <tt>"one"</tt>, <tt>"two"</tt> as arguments
      and <tt>"ENVVAR1=1"</tt>, <tt>"ENVVAR2=2"</tt> as environment variables. To see the result in the invoked program,
      we use <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/630754/#show_info">another simple program (<tt>show_info.c</tt>)</a> that just outputs its command-line arguments
      (<tt>argv</tt>) and environment
      (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html"><tt>environ</tt></a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting these together gives the expected result â€” the arguments and environment are passed through to the
      invoked program. Notice, though, that the <tt>argv[0]</tt> for the invoked binary is just the value specified by
      the caller of <tt>execve()</tt>; having the program's name in <tt>argv[0]</tt> isn't a convention that's required or
      policed by <tt>execve()</tt> itself, at least for binaries.

<tt></tt></p><pre><tt>    % ./do_execve ./show_info
    argv[0] = 'zero'
    argv[1] = 'one'
    argv[2] = 'two'
    ENVVAR1=1
    ENVVAR2=2
</tt></pre>
    <p>
      Things change slightly when the program being invoked is a script rather than a binary program.  To explore this,
      we use a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/630754/#show_info.sh">shell script
      equivalent (<tt>show_info.sh</tt>)</a> of our environment-outputting
      program; 
      putting this together with the original program that invokes <tt>execve()</tt>, we see a couple of differences:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    % ./do_execve ./show_info.sh
    $0 = './show_info.sh'
    $1 = 'one'
    $2 = 'two'
    ENVVAR1=1
    ENVVAR2=2
    PWD=/home/drysdale/src/lwn/exec
</pre></tt>
    <p>
      First, the environment has gained an extra <tt>PWD</tt> value, indicating the current directory. Secondly, the
      initial argument to the script is now the script filename, rather than the <tt>"zero"</tt> value that the invoker
      specified.  A further experiment reveals that the <tt>/bin/sh</tt> script interpreter added the <tt>PWD</tt>
      environment variable, but the kernel itself modified the arguments:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    % cat ./wrapper
    #!./show_info
    
    % ./do_execve ./wrapper
    argv[0] = './show_info'
    argv[1] = './wrapper'
    argv[2] = 'one'
    argv[3] = 'two'
    ENVVAR1=1
    ENVVAR2=2
</pre></tt>
    <p>
      More specifically, the kernel has removed the first (<tt>"zero"</tt>) argument and replaced it with two arguments
      â€” the name of the script interpreter program (taken from the first line of the script) and the name
      of the invoked file (which holds the script text).  If the first line of the script also includes command-line
      arguments for the interpreter (for example, <tt>awk</tt> needs an <tt>-f</tt> option to treat its input as a
      filename rather than script text), a third extra argument is also inserted, holding all of the extra options:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    % cat ./wrapper_args
    #!./show_info -a -b -c

    % ./do_execve ./wrapper_args
    argv[0] = './show_info'
    argv[1] = '-a -b -c'
    argv[2] = './wrapper_args'
    argv[3] = 'one'
    argv[4] = 'two'
    ENVVAR1=1
    ENVVAR2=2
</pre></tt>
    <p>
      Up to a point, we can also repeat this pop-one, push-two alteration of the arguments, by invoking scripts that
      wrap scripts and so on; each such alteration effectively pushes the wrapper script name in at <tt>argv[1]</tt>:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    argv[0]:  'zero'=&gt;'./wrapper4'=&gt;'./wrapper3'=&gt;'./wrapper2'=&gt;'./wrapper' =&gt;'./show_info'
    argv[1]:  'one'   './wrapper5'  './wrapper4'  './wrapper3'  './wrapper2'  './wrapper'
    argv[2]:  'two'   'one'         './wrapper5'  './wrapper4'  './wrapper3'  './wrapper2'
    argv[3]:          'two'         'one'         './wrapper5'  './wrapper4'  './wrapper3'
    argv[4]:                        'two'         'one'         './wrapper5'  './wrapper4'
    argv[5]:                                      'two'         'one'         './wrapper5'
    argv[6]:                                                    'two'         'one'
    argv[7]:                                                                  'two'
</pre></tt>
    <p>
      However, this doesn't continue forever â€” once there are too many levels of wrappers, the process fails with <tt>ELOOP</tt>:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    % ./do_execve ./wrapper6
    Failed to execute './wrapper6', Too many levels of symbolic links
</pre></tt>


    <h4>Into the kernel: <tt>struct linux_binprm</tt></h4>
    <p>
      Now we move into kernel space and begin delving into the code that implements the <tt>execve()</tt> system call. A
      <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/604515/">previous article</a> explored the general system call machinery
      (and the special wrinkles needed for <tt>execve()</tt>), so
      we can pick up the story at the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1430"><tt>do_execve_common()</tt></a> function
      in <tt>fs/exec.c</tt>.  The main purpose of the code in this function
    is to <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1463">build</a>
    a new 
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/binfmts.h?v=3.18#L14"><tt>struct linux_binprm</tt></a> instance that describes the
      current program invocation operation.  In the structure:
    </p>
    <ul class="spacylist">
      <li>The <tt>file</tt> field is <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1481">set</a> to a freshly opened <tt>struct file</tt>
        for the program being invoked; this allows the kernel to read the file contents and decide how to handle the
        file.</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>filename</tt> and <tt>interp</tt> fields are <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1482">both set</a> to the
        name of the file holding the program; we'll see later why there are
        two distinct fields here.</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>bprm_mm_init()</tt> function <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L366">allocates</a>
        and <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L268">sets
        up</a> the
        associated <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L345"><tt>struct mm_struct</tt></a> and
        <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L247"><tt>struct vm_area_struct</tt></a> data structures in preparation
        for managing the virtual memory of the new program.  In particular, the new program's virtual memory ends at
        the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/include/asm/processor.h?v=3.18#L912">highest possible address</a> for the
        architecture; its stack will grow downward from there.</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>p</tt> field is <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L281">set to point at the end of memory space</a> for the new program,
        but leaves space for a NULL pointer as an end marker for the stack.
        The value of <tt>p</tt> will be updated (downward) as more 
        information is added to the new program's stack.</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>argc</tt> and <tt>envc</tt> fields <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1488">are set</a> to hold the counts of arguments
        and environment values so that this information can be propagated to the new program later in the invocation
        process.</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>unsafe</tt> field is <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1217">set up</a> to hold a bitmask of reasons why the program
        execution might not be safe; for example, if the process is
        being traced with <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html"><tt>ptrace()</tt></a> or has the
        <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/475678/"><tt>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</tt> bit</a>
        set.  The Linux Security Module (LSM) may subsequently use this
        information to deny the 
        program execution operation.</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>cred</tt> field is a <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1147">separately
        allocated</a> object of type
        <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/cred.h?v=3.18#L102"><tt>struct cred</tt></a> that
        holds information about the credentials for the new program.  These are generally
        <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/cred.c?v=3.18#L250">inherited</a>
        from the process that called <tt>execve()</tt>, but
        are updated to allow for <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1274">setuid</a> / <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1280">setgid</a> bits and
        other complications. The presence of setuid/setgid bits also
        disallows a collection of <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/uapi/linux/personality.h?v=3.18#L30">compatibility
        features</a> because they have an adverse effect on security; the
        <tt>per_clear</tt> field records the bits in the process's <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/personality.2.html">personality</a>
        that will be cleared later.
</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>security</tt> field allows an LSM to store LSM-specific
        information with
        the <tt>linux_binprm</tt>; the LSM is notified via a call to
        <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/security/security.c?v=3.18#L214"><tt>security_bprm_set_creds()</tt></a> and the
        <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/security.h?v=3.18#L202"><tt>bprm_set_creds</tt></a> LSM hook.
        The <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/security.h?v=3.18#L1996">default implementation</a> of this hook
        updates the new program's
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">Linux capabilities</a>
        to <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/security/commoncap.c?v=3.18#L475">allow for the file capabilities</a> of the program file;
        other LSM
        implementations chain this
        behavior into their own implementations of the hook (e.g. <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/security/smack/smack_lsm.c?v=3.18#L676">Smack</a>, 
        <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/security/selinux/hooks.c?v=3.18#L2144">SELinux</a>).</li>
	
      <li>The <tt>buf</tt> scratch space is <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1299">filled</a> with the first chunk
        (<a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/uapi/linux/binfmts.h?v=3.18#L18">128 bytes</a>) of data from the program file. This data
        will be used later to detect the binary format so it can be
        processed appropriately.</li>
	
    </ul>
    <p>
      The parts of this setup process that depend on the particular file that's being executed are performed
      in an inner <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1253"><tt>prepare_binprm()</tt></a> function; this function can be called
      again later to update those fields if a different file (e.g. a script interpreter) is actually run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, information about the program invocation is copied into the top of new program's stack, using the local
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L453"><tt>copy_strings()</tt></a>
      and <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L544"><tt>copy_strings_kernel()</tt></a> utility functions.  First, the program
      filename is pushed to the stack (and its location is <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1504">saved</a> in the <tt>exec</tt> field of
      the <tt>linux_bprm</tt> instance), followed by all of the environment values, then by all of the arguments.  At
      the end of this process, the stack looks like:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    ---------Memory limit---------
    NULL pointer
    program_filename string
    envp[envc-1] string
    ...

    <h4>Binary format handler iteration: <tt>struct linux_binfmt</tt></h4>
    <p>
      With a complete <tt>struct linux_binprm</tt> in hand, the real business of program execution is performed
      in <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1405"><tt>exec_binprm()</tt></a> and (more importantly)
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1352"><tt>search_binary_handler()</tt></a>.  This code
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1369">iterates</a> over a list of
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/binfmts.h#L70"><tt>struct linux_binfmt</tt></a> objects, each of which provides a handler for a particular
      format of binary programs.  A binary handler could potentially be defined in a kernel module, so the code
      calls <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/module.c?v=3.18#L945"><tt>try_module_get()</tt></a>
      for each format to ensure the relevant code can't be unloaded by another task while it's being used here.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each <tt>struct linux_binfmt</tt> handler object, the <tt>load_binary()</tt> function pointer is called, passing in
      the <tt>linux_binprm</tt> object. If the handler code supports the binary format, it does whatever is needed to
      prepare the program for execution and returns success (&gt;= 0).  Otherwise, the handler returns a failure code (&lt; 0)
      and iteration continues with the next handler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Execution of a particular program may itself rely on execution of a different program; the obvious example is
      executable scripts, which need to invoke the script interpreter.  To cope with this,
      the <tt>search_binary_handler()</tt> code can be called recursively, re-using the <tt>struct linux_binprm</tt>
      object.  However, recursion depth is <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1358">limited</a> to prevent infinite
      recursion, giving the <tt>ELOOP</tt> error behavior seen earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system's LSM also gets a say in the operation; before the iteration over binary formats starts, the
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/security.h?v=3.18#L214"><tt>bprm_check_security</tt></a> LSM hook is
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1362">triggered</a>, allowing the LSM to make a decision on whether to allow the
      operation.  To do so,  it may use the state it stored in the <tt>linux_binprm.security</tt> field earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the iteration, if no formats that can handle the
    program have been 
      found (and the program appears to be binary rather than text, at least
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/exec.c?v=3.18#L1392">according to the first four bytes</a>),
      then the code will also attempt to load a module named <tt>"binfmt-<i>XXXX</i>"</tt>, where
      XXXX is the hex value of bytes three and four in the program file.
    This is an 
      <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kerneld/configuration.html#BINFMT">old mechanism</a>
      (added in 1996 for Linux 1.3.57) to allow for a more dynamic
      way of associating binary format handlers with formats; the more recent <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> mechanism
      (described below) allows a more flexible way of doing something similar.
    </p>


    <h4>Binary formats</h4>
    <p>
      So what are the binary formats available in the standard kernel?  A search for
      code that registers instances of <tt>struct linux_binfmt</tt> (via
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/binfmts.h?v=3.17#L82"><tt>register_binfmt()</tt></a> and
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/binfmts.h?v=3.17#L87"><tt>insert_binfmt()</tt></a>)
      gives us quite a collection of possible formats,  all of which are configured and
      explained in the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/Kconfig.binfmt"><tt>fs/Kconfig.binfmts</tt></a> file:
    </p>
    <ul class="spacylist">

        PA-RISC format).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (plus a couple
      of other architecture-specific formats).
    </p>
    <p>
      The next  sections will examine the most important of these: interpreted scripts and
      the "miscellaneous" mechanism for supporting arbitrary formats; the next article
      will examine the ELF binary format â€” which is typically where all program execution ends up.
    </p>


    <h4>Script invocation: <tt>binfmt_script.c</tt></h4>
    <p>
      Files that start with the character sequence <tt>#!</tt> (and have the execute bit set) are treated as scripts,
      handled by the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c"><tt>fs/binfmt_script.c</tt></a> handler.  After checking those first two
      bytes, this code parses the rest of the script-invocation line, splitting it into an interpreter
      name (everything after <tt>#!</tt> up to the first white space) and possible arguments (everything else up to the
      end of the line, stripping external white space).
    </p>
    <p>
      (One detail to note: back when the <tt>struct linux_binprm</tt> object was created, only the first 128 bytes of the
      program were retrieved.  This means that if the interpreter name and arguments are longer than this, the
      results will be truncated.)
    </p>
    <p>
      With these in hand, the code then <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L69">removes <tt>argv[0]</tt></a> from
      the top of the new program's stack (i.e. at the lowest address), and in its place pushes the following,
      adjusting the <tt>argc</tt> value in the <tt>linux_binprm</tt> object along the way:
    </p>
    <ul class="spacylist">
      <li>the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L72">program name</a></li>
      <li>(optionally) the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L76">collected interpreter arguments</a></li>
      <li>the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L80">name of the interpreter program</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Taken together, this explains the user space behavior we observed at the beginning of the article; our new
      program's stack is modified to look like:
    </p>
<tt><pre>    ---------Memory limit---------
    NULL pointer
    program_filename string
    envp[envc-1] string
    ...
    envp[1] string
    envp[0] string
    argv[argc-1] string
    ...
    argv[1] string
    program_filename string
    ( interpreter_args )
    interpreter_filename string
</pre></tt>
    <p>
      The code also <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L83">changes the <tt>interp</tt> value</a> in
      the <tt>linux_binprm</tt> structure so that it references the interpreter filename, rather than the script filename.
      This explains why the <tt>linux_binprm</tt> structure refers to two strings: one (<tt>interp</tt>) is the program
      that we currently want to execute, and one is the name (<tt>filename</tt>) that was originally invoked in
      the <tt>execve()</tt> call.  Along similar lines, the <tt>file</tt> field in the <tt>linux_binprm</tt> is also
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L94">updated</a> to reference the new interpreter program, and the first
      128 bytes of its contents <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L95">read into</a> the <tt>buf</tt> scratch
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The script handler code then <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_script.c?v=3.18#L98">recurses</a>
      into <tt>search_binary_handler()</tt> to repeat the whole process for the script interpreter program.
      If the interpreter is itself a script, then the <tt>interp</tt> value will be changed once again
      but the <tt>filename</tt> will stay unchanged.
    </p>


    <h4>Miscellaneous interpreter detection: <tt>binfmt_misc.c</tt></h4>
    <p>
      We saw previously that early versions of the Linux kernel supported a rough-and-ready way of dynamically adding
      format support, by hunting for a kernel module with a name containing the early bytes of the binary.
      That's not particularly convenient â€” only searching on a couple of bytes is very limited (compare the
      <a href="https://github.com/file/file/tree/master/magic/Magdir">vast range of detection signatures</a> that the
      <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html"><tt>file</tt></a> command uses) and
      requiring a kernel module raises the barrier to entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt">miscellaneous binary format handler</a> allows a more flexible
      and dynamic method of dealing with new formats, by allowing run-time configuration (via a special
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_misc.c?v=3.18#L727">filesystem</a> mounted under <tt>/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc</tt>) to
      specify:
    </p>
    <ul class="spacylist">
      <li>How to recognize a supported format, based on filename extension
    or a magic value at a particular offset. (As with 
      parsing script interpreters, this magic value has to fall within the first 128 bytes of the program file.)</li>
      <li>The interpreter program to invoke, which will get the program filename passed to it as <tt>argv[1]</tt> (as
      with script invocation).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A good example of the miscellaneous format handler in use is for <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/java.txt">Java
      files</a>: detect <tt>.class</tt> files (based on
      their <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1"><tt>0xCAFEBABE</tt>
      prefix</a>) or <tt>.jar</tt> files (based on the <tt>.jar</tt> extension) and
      automatically invoke the JVM executable on
      them.  This will require a wrapper script to provide the relevant command-line arguments, as the miscellaneous
      configuration doesn't allow arguments to be specified â€” which means that the miscellaneous handler will
      invoke the script handler, which will then invoke the ELF handler for the JVM executable (and which will probably in
      turn invoke the dynamic linker <tt>ld.so</tt>, although that's a somewhat different story).
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally, the <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_misc.c">kernel implementation</a> for this format is similar to the
      handler for script programs described above, except that there is an initial
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_misc.c?v=3.18#L85">search for a matching configuration entry</a>,
      and that configuration is used to make some of the details (such as
      <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/binfmt_misc.c?v=3.18#L145">removing <tt>argv[0]</tt></a>)
      optional.
    </p>


    <p>
      The format handlers for both scripts and miscellaneous formats recurse on to attempt to invoke the interpreter
      program that is needed for that particular format.  This recursion has to end at some point, and on a modern Linux
      system this is almost always at an ELF binary program â€” the
      subject of the next article â€” stay tuned.

space).

Linux passes the remainder of the line as a _single_ argument. You show 
this in your example where "-a -b -c" are all located in argv[1]. But 
you say

<blockquote>
... a third extra argument is also inserted, holding all of the extra options:
</blockquote>

<p>
Those aren't extra options--the plural is misleading. The distinction 
matters because neither getopt nor getopt_long will parse "-a -b -c" as 
three separate options. Rather, it'll be parsed as optc='a' and optarg="
 -b -c", or it will parse as optc='a', optc=' ', optc='-', optc='b', 
etc. Most likely it'll just fail because your option specification won't
 match the parse. If a, b, and c are all single options without 
arguments, then you could put "-abc" on the shebang line. But you can't 
space them out, and you can't use an option that takes an argument 
unless the argument is the path of the script, as with the -f option for
 awk. And you can't mix non-argument with argument options unless the 
sole argument-taking option comes last. For example, "-abcf".
</p>

<p>
OS X, by contrast, will field-split the trailing shebang line in the 
kernel so that the script "#!./show_info -a -b -c" will print out
</p>

<pre>argv[0] = './show_info'
argv[1] = '-a'
argv[2] = '-b'
argv[3] = '-c'
</pre>

<p>
Solaris is quirky. It will field-split, but only includes the first field. So "#!./show_info -a -b -c" will print out
</p>

<pre>argv[0] = './show_info'
argv[1] = '-a'
</pre>

<p>
FWIW, OpenBSD 5.5, NetBSD 6.1, and FreeBSD 9.0 all behave like Linux. 
Which was surprising because I could have sworn that either FreeBSD or 
NetBSD (or both) would field-split the remainder of the shebang line.

Thanks for the clarification &amp; comparisons with other OSes -- I

    <p>
FWIW, Linux and OS X are the only systems I'm aware of that permit 
recursive shebang execution. Some systems, like Free/Net/OpenBSD, will 
recursively search for the binary interpreter, but they won't stack the 
paths of the intervening interpreters. Instead the binary interpreter is
 only passed the original file path. (And any trailing shebang arguments
 in the scripts seem to get dropped altogether.) 
</p>

<p>
That's not germane to how Linux executes binaries. But I have a feeling 
this page might end up near the top of the Google results (as all good 
LWN articles do) for shebang-related queries, so it's worth putting out 
there.
</p>

<p>
Because shells parse scripts line-by-line, if you can come up with a 
construct that is both valid shell code and valid code in your other 
language, you can mix interpreters portably. For example, the following 
is a mixed shell/Lua script which will locate a Lua interpreter. Because
 both the locations _and_ interpreter names of Lua differ across 
systems, even across Linux distributions, and even for the same version 
of Lua, you can't use the #!/usr/bin/env trick to run your Lua scripts 
and expect it to work even remotely reliably.
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh
_=[[ # variable assignment in shell, beginning of long string in Lua
IFS=:
for D in ${PATH:-$(command -p getconf PATH)}; do
    for F in ${D}/lua*; do
         # check if it's our preferred version
        if ...; then
            exec "${F}" "$0" "$@"
        fi
    done
done
printf "%s: unable to locate Lua interpreter\n" "${0##*/}" &gt;&amp;2
exit 1
]]
-- begin pure Lua code
print(_VERSION)
</pre>

<p>
I recently published a script, <a href="http://www.25thandclement.com/%7Ewilliam/projects/runlua.html">runlua</a>, for portable execution of Lua scripts, which is why all of this stuff is still fresh in my mind.

    GNU Guile has a special "<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/The-Meta-Switch.html">meta switch</a>"
 which instructs the interpreter to interpret the first few lines of the
 file -- up to a line containing only "!#" -- as arguments to the 
interpreter rather than as source code.  It seems to work quite well:

<pre>#!/usr/local/bin/guile \
-e main -s
!#
(define (main args)
        (map (lambda (arg) (display arg) (display " "))
             (cdr args))
