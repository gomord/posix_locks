<div class="ArticleText"><p> There are many mechanisms for communicating information between
user-space applications and the kernel. System calls and pseudo-filesystems
such as <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/sys</tt> are of course the most well known.
Signals are similarly well known; the kernel employs signals to
inform a process of various synchronous or asynchronous eventsâ€”for
example, when the process tries to write to a broken pipe or a child of the
process terminates.
 
</p><p> There are also a number of more obscure mechanisms for communication
between the kernel and user space.  These include the Linux-specific <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/131802/">netlink sockets</a> and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-user-space-apps/index.html">user-mode
helper</a> features. Netlink sockets provide a socket-style API for
exchanging information with the kernel. The user-mode helper feature allows
the kernel to automatically invoke user-space executables; this mechanism
is used in a number of places, including the implementation of control
groups and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html">piping core dumps
to a user-space application</a>. 

</p><p> The auxiliary vector, a mechanism for communicating information from
the kernel to user space, has remained largely invisible until
now. However, with the addition of a new library function,
<tt>getauxval()</tt>, in the GNU C library (glibc) 2.16 release that
appeared at the end of June, it has now become more visible.

</p><blockquote>
<img alt="[Location of auxiliary
vector in process address space]" src="getauxval%28%29%20and%20the%20auxiliary%20vector%20%5BLWN.net%5D_files/auxvec.png" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="180" align="right">
</blockquote><p> Historically, many UNIX systems have implemented the auxiliary vector
feature.  In essence, it is a list of key-value pairs that the kernel's ELF
binary loader (<tt>fs/binfmt_elf.c</tt> in the kernel source) constructs
when a new executable image is loaded into a process. This list is placed
at a specific location in the process's address space; on Linux systems it
sits at the high end of the user address space, just above the (downwardly
growing) stack, the command-line arguments (<i>argv</i>), and environment
variables (<i>environ</i>).

</p><p> From the description and diagram, we can see that although the
auxiliary vector is somewhat hidden, it is accessible with a little
effort. Even without using the new library function, an application that
wants to access the auxiliary vector merely needs to obtain the address of
the location that follows the <tt>NULL</tt> pointer at the end of the
environment list.  Furthermore, at the shell level, we can discover the
auxiliary vector that was supplied to an executable by setting the
<tt>LD_SHOW_AUXV</tt> environment variable when launching an application:

</p><pre>    $ <b>LD_SHOW_AUXV=1 sleep 1000</b>
    AT_SYSINFO_EHDR: 0x7fff35d0d000
    AT_HWCAP:        bfebfbff
    AT_PAGESZ:       4096
    AT_CLKTCK:       100
    AT_PHDR:         0x400040
    AT_PHENT:        56
    AT_PHNUM:        9
    AT_BASE:         0x0
    AT_FLAGS:        0x0
    AT_ENTRY:        0x40164c
    AT_UID:          1000
    AT_EUID:         1000
    AT_GID:          1000
    AT_EGID:         1000
    AT_SECURE:       0
    AT_RANDOM:       0x7fff35c2a209
    AT_EXECFN:       /usr/bin/sleep
    AT_PLATFORM:     x86_64
</pre><p> The auxiliary vector of each process on the system is also visible via
a corresponding <tt>/proc/PID/auxv</tt> file. Dumping the contents of the
file that corresponds to the above command (as eight-byte decimal numbers,
because the keys and values are of that size on the 64-bit system used for
this example), we can see the key-value pairs in the vector, followed by a
pair of zero values that indicate the end of the vector:

</p><pre>    $ <b>od -t d8 /proc/15558/auxv</b>

</pre><p> Scanning the high end of user-space memory or <tt>/proc/PID/auxv</tt>
is a clumsy way of retrieving values from the auxiliary vector. The new
library function provides a simpler mechanism for retrieving individual
values from the list:

</p><pre>    #include &lt;sys/auxv.h&gt;

    unsigned long int getauxval(unsigned long int type);
</pre><p> The function takes a key as its single argument, and returns the
corresponding value.  The glibc header files define a set of symbolic
constants with names of the form <tt>AT_*</tt> for the key value passed to
<tt>getauxval()</tt>; these names are exactly the same as the strings
displayed when executing a command with <tt>LD_SHOW_AUXV=1</tt>.

</p><p> Of course, the obvious question by now is: what sort of information is
placed in the auxiliary vector, and who needs that information?  The
primary customer of the auxiliary vector is the dynamic linker
(<tt>ld-linux.so</tt>).  In the usual scheme of things, the kernel's ELF
binary loader constructs a process image by loading an executable into the
process's memory, and likewise loading the dynamic linker into memory. At
this point, the dynamic linker is ready to take over the task of loading
any shared libraries that the program may need in preparation for handing
control to the program itself.  However, it lacks some pieces of
information that are essential for these tasks: the location of the program
inside the virtual address space, and the starting address at which
execution of the program should commence.

</p><p> In theory, the kernel could provide a system call that the 
dynamic
linker could use in order to obtain the required information. However, 
this
would be an inefficient way of doing things: the kernel's program loader
 already has the information (because it has scanned the 
ELF binary and built the process image) and
knows that the dynamic linker will need it.  Rather than maintaining a
record of this information until the dynamic linker requests it, the 
kernel
can simply make it available in the process image at some location known
 to
the dynamic linker. That location is, of course, the auxiliary vector.

</p><p> It turns out that there's a range of other information that the
kernel's program loader already has and which it knows the dynamic linker
will need.  By placing all of this information in the auxiliary vector, the
kernel either saves the programming overhead of making this information
available in some other way (e.g., by implementing a dedicated system
call), or saves the dynamic linker the cost of making a system call, or
both. Among the values placed in the auxiliary vector and available via
<tt>getauxval()</tt> are the following:

</p><ul>

<li> <tt>AT_PHDR</tt> and <tt>AT_ENTRY</tt>: The values for these keys
are the address of the ELF program headers of the executable and the entry
address of the executable. The dynamic linker uses this information to
perform linking and pass control to the executable.


</li><li> <tt>AT_SECURE</tt>: The kernel assigns a nonzero value to this key
if this executable should be treated <i>securely</i>. This setting may be
triggered by a Linux Security Module, but the common reason is that the
kernel recognizes that the process is executing a set-user-ID or
set-group-ID program.  In this case, the dynamic linker disables the use of
certain environment variables (as described in the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld-linux.so.8.html"><tt>ld-linux.so(8)</tt>
manual page</a>) and the C library changes other aspects of its behavior.

</li><li> <tt>AT_UID</tt>, <tt>AT_EUID</tt>, <tt>AT_GID</tt>, and
<tt>AT_EGID</tt>: These are the real and effective user and group IDs of
the process.  Making these values available in the vector saves the dynamic
linker the cost of making system calls to determine the values. If the
<tt>AT_SECURE</tt> value is not available, the dynamic linker uses these
values to make a decision about whether to handle the executable securely.



</li><li> <tt>AT_PAGESZ</tt>: The value is the system page size.  The
dynamic linker needs this information during the linking phase, and the C
library uses it in the implementation of the <tt>malloc</tt> family of
functions.


</li><li> <tt>AT_PLATFORM</tt>: The value is a pointer to a string
identifying the hardware platform on which the program is running. In some
circumstances, the dynamic linker uses this value in the interpretation of
<tt>rpath</tt> values. (The <tt>ld-linux.so(8)</tt> man page describes
<tt>rpath</tt> values.)


</li><li> <tt>AT_SYSINFO_EHDR</tt>: The value is a pointer to the page
containing the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (VDSO) that the kernel creates
in order to provide fast implementations of certain system calls. (Some
documentation on the VDSO can be found in the kernel source file
<tt>Documentation/ABI/stable/vdso</tt>.)


</li><li> <tt>AT_HWCAP</tt>: The value is a pointer to a multibyte mask of
bits whose settings indicate detailed processor capabilities.  This
information can be used to provide optimized behavior for certain library
functions. The contents of the bit mask are hardware dependent (for
example, see the kernel source file
<tt>arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h</tt> for details relating to the
Intel x86 architecture).


</li><li> <tt>AT_RANDOM</tt>: The value is a pointer to sixteen random bytes
provided by the kernel. The dynamic linker uses this to implement a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow#Stack_canaries">stack
canary</a>.

</li></ul><p> The precise reasons why the GNU C library developers have chosen to add
the <tt>getauxval()</tt> function now are a little unclear. The commit
message and NEWS file entry for the change were merely brief explanations
of what the change was, rather than why it was made. The only <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/519195/">clue</a> provided by the implementer on the
libc-alpha mailing list suggested that doing so was useful to allow for
"<span>future enhancements to the AT_ values, especially target-specific
ones</span>."  That comment, plus the observation that the glibc developers
tend to be rather conservative about adding new interfaces to the ABI,
suggest that that they have some interesting new user-space uses of the
auxiliary vector in mind.</p><hr width="60%" align="left"><p style="display: inline;" class="readability-styled">
